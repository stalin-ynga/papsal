In this example we demonstrate how we can integrate a HTML editor in jqGrid form editiing module.

For this purpose we create a custom element in the form and use a custom function to get and set the value in the server.

The only what you need to know for the editor is how the value can be get and how can be updated when a new data comes from the grid.
